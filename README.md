# Mice-Vs-Humans-Cell-Comparison-Project

*Kaushika Uppu, Emily Obedoza*

Our analysis explores the differences in dendritic morphology (spiny, aspiny, sparsely spiny) between mice and humans and fast-spiking electrophysiology characteristics through expression of genes GAD1 and GAD2. Morphological and electrophysiological data was obtained from the Allen Brain Atlas Cell Types database to compare dendritic type between mice and humans and fast-spiking electrophysiology features between cell types. RNA-Seq data was also obtained from the Allen Brain Map database to relate gene expression to these characteristics. Results indicated that there were greater levels of aspiny neurons in mice compared to humans, significantly greater expression of GAD genes in mice than humans, and significantly steeper F/I curves in aspiny neurons compared to spiny neurons.
